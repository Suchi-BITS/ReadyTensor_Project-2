Cloud Cost Governance

Cloud cost governance involves establishing processes, controls, and policies to ensure that cloud usage aligns with organizational budgets, compliance requirements, and financial goals.

Governance Framework

A robust governance model includes:

Policies for provisioning and deprovisioning

Tagging and resource ownership rules

Budget guardrails

Cost monitoring and alerting

Approval workflows for expensive resources

Tagging and Resource Metadata

Tagging is central to governance. Essential tags may include:

Owner

Environment

Cost Center

Application

Compliance Tier

Automated Policies

Tools like AWS Config, Azure Policy, and GCP Organization Policies help enforce governance rules such as:

Preventing creation of untagged resources

Blocking expensive instance types

Enforcing encryption standards

Restricting public access

Policy-as-Code

Infrastructure-as-Code platforms (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation) enable cost governance using Policy-as-Code.
This ensures resources follow governance standards from the moment they are created.

Budget Enforcement

Organizations enforce budgets through:

Hard limits

Soft alerts

Quotas

Spend-based auto-remediation

Governance ensures cloud costs remain predictable, secure, and aligned with business priorities.
