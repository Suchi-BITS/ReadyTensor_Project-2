Cloud Financial Operations Maturity Model

The FinOps Maturity Model defines how organizations evolve their cloud financial management practices over time. It spans capabilities, culture, tooling, finance-engineering collaboration, and automation.

Three-Level Maturity Model

Level 1: Crawl
Organizations gain basic visibility into cloud spending, implement tagging standards, and begin simple reporting. Responsibility is siloed and mainly reactive.

Level 2: Walk
Organizations automate spend allocation, adopt budgeting workflows, and implement optimization practices such as rightsizing, reserved capacity planning, and anomaly detection. Teams begin sharing ownership of cloud efficiency.

Level 3: Run
Advanced FinOps culture emerges. Teams use predictive forecasting, full automation for policy enforcement, integrated dashboards, and mature purchasing strategies. Continuous monitoring, engineering accountability, and cost-per-unit economics are standardized.
